# Conan / Cmake Integration Demo

Forked from https://github.com/tomtom-international/interview-exercises


## **TL;DR**

What works:
- creating conan package locally, including `export`
- `catch2` tests are passing

What **does not work** yet
- exporting package to the system (`export-pkg`)
- test app using `conanfile.txt`
- `docker` build


## Quick Start
Unix system with c++ toolchain and `Python 3.8+` is required

```bash
cd interview-excersises/libgreeting
./packer.sh dev
```
